Welcome to the past investment simulator!

Many times we ask ourselves "What if I had made an investment at some point of my life? How much money could I have gained / lost? 🤔

This application uses the information provided by the Fintual API and is responsible for answering that investment hypothesis that "could have been", the steps to use it are super simple! 😁

1. Enter an amount in Chilean pesos (example: 2000000 * only whole numbers! Without periods or commas 🙃)
2. Please enter a date (\*from 2018-02-12 to today*\. Unfortunately, this app still can't predict the future ...)
3. Choose how you would have distributed your funds, from the riskiest to the most conservative, the important thing is that you do not go over 100%!
4. Press the "Simulate" button and voila! You will have the result of your investment "what if". 😎
5. If you wish, you can re-simulate with new amounts and dates.
